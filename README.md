# Electric vehicle rental | ElectronJS
### Â¡Hi!
This is a project that I did in college.
Since I used the ElectronJS framework, it is an application made mainly in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. For the connection to the database, I used NodeJS.
It is necessary to have [NodeJS and NPM](https://nodejs.org/es/download/) installed and install the dependencies in the project directory.
```
cd 'directorio_del_proyecto'
npm install
```

### Database setup
The database is [XAMPP MySQL](https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html), access must be 'root' and without password.
After that, you just have to copy the file "BD.txt" where the tables and data already created are located.

*Note: To see the administrator screen, just enter `admin@dom.com` as email, and ` admin12345` as password. You can change this in the 'clientes' table which is the row with id_cliente `1`*
